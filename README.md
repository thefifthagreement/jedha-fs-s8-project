# Building a Machine Learning web app

In this two projects I use FLASK framework, PostgreSql database and pickles from pre-trained models. 

## Project 1 : [SMS SPAM DETECTOR](https://github.com/thefifthagreement/jedha-fs-s8-project/tree/master/sms%20spam%20detector)

In this project, I build a web app where a user enters a SMS text in a form. Then the message feeds a pre-trained model predicting whether or not the message is a spam.

To help build this app, I followed this tutorial on Towards Data Science :

[Develop a NLP model model in Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/develop-a-nlp-model-in-python-deploy-it-with-flask-step-by-step-744f3bdd7776)


## Project 2 : [Word Count avec NLTK](https://github.com/thefifthagreement/jedha-fs-s8-project/tree/master/word_count_nltk)

In this project, the web app connects a PostgreSql database. The user gives a website adress link. The app then returns a word count and a ranking of the most frequent words on the website page.

To help build this app, I followed this example :
